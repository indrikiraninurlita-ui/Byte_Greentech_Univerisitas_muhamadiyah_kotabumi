                            Greentech, or green technology, has evolved from early conservation ideas in the 1800s to a 
                            global movement for sustainable innovation. Sparked by rising awareness of environmental damage during the 
                            Industrial Revolution and amplified by events like the 1970 Earth Day and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, the 
                            movement gained momentum with policies like the Clean Air Act and institutions like the EPA. In the late 20th century, 
                            renewable energy, green architecture, and recycling emerged, leading to the modern greentech era marked by solar, wind, 
                            electric vehicles, and smart infrastructure. Key global agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement drove cooperation, 
                            while recent advances such as AI for climate, 
                            green hydrogen, and circular economy practices are shaping a net-zero future

                            Solar panels are devices that convert sunlight into electricity using a technology called the photovoltaic effect. 
                            They are made up of many solar cells, usually composed of silicon, that absorb sunlight and release electrons, 
                            generating a flow of electric current. This electricity, in the form of direct current (DC), 
                            is then converted into alternating current (AC) by an inverter for use in homes, businesses, or the power grid.

                            These turbines have large blades that spin when wind blows, turning a rotor connected to a shaft, which drives a generator to produce electricity. 
                            Wind energy is clean, abundant, and sustainable, offering benefits like low emissions, reduced electricity costs, and minimal operating expenses.
